# Deep convolutional Ritz method: parametric PDE surrogates without labeled data

Here, we propose an extension to the Deep Energy Method (DEM)
to resolve stress concentrations for finite strain hyperelasticity[1]. The developed framework termed mixed
Deep Energy Method (mDEM) introduces stress measures as an additional output of the neural network to
the recently introduced pure displacement formulation[2].
